            Manhattan: A Tale of Two Population Extremes
          </div>
          <div id="about-text">
            <p>
              Measuring just 13 miles long by 2 miles wide, New York City's
              most-famous borough has a well-earned reputation for shoebox-sized
              apartments, shoulder-to-shoulder subway commutes, and cubicle-farm
              high-rises. Though the US Census provides a cozy estimate of 1.6
              million people calling Manhattan 'home', the island's true
              population swells considerably, like clock-work, every Monday
              through Friday. Obtaining upper bounds on the workday population
              of Manhattan is no easy task, and the NYU Wagner School has{" "}

                ballparked a peak estimate
              </a>{" "}
              of about 4 million people, representing an influx of roughly the
              population of Houston every workday. To put this in perspective,
              if Manhattan were a state, it would sit just above Oregon at{" "}
              <em>27th</em> on a list of U.S. states ranked by population every
              afternoon.
            </p>
            <p>
              Though the upper and lower bound for Manhattan's dynamic
              population provides an interesting point of conversation, the
              question of how Manhattan's population is distributed
              hour-by-hour, neighborhood-by-neighborhood is of importance to
              urban planners, public safety managers, and armchair geographers
              alike. By no means does Manhattan's population spread out evenly
              across the length of island- one can imagine the Empire State
              Building being filled to the brim with inter-state workers by late
              morning, while at the same time much of the working-age population
              of Inwood has migrated away from its sleepy uptown hamlet. Finding
              appropriate sources for estimating the dynamic population was part
              of a research project undertaken by Justin Fung while studying at
              Columbia University under the direction of former NYC
              Transportation Commissioner Lucius J. Riccio, and ultimately, a
              transit-based solution was found right under their feet.
              Considering the 'vehicle-of-choice' for most Manhattanites is one
              of the MTA's 6,500 stainless-steel subway cars, and that the
              nearly 150 stations serving Manhattan provide reasonably-uniform
              coverage across the island, it stood to reason that subway
              entrance and exit data would be a pretty good proxy for population
              distribution across the city.

              , estimates for the net flows of people in and out of Manhattan
              neighborhoods were made on an hour-by-hour basis both historically
              and for future dates. A time-series analysis of this data confirms
              that usage patterns are heavily dependent on time, day, and
              location. The visualization contained herein is the realization of
              a model of these flows for a hypothetical week in late Spring. As
              you click around Manhattan, you may uncover both obvious and
              not-so-obvious patterns, and perhaps even find a good time to take
              a stress-free bike ride around the block.
